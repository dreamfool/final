# final
This is the final project for GA's Javascript Circuit.  The "Everywhere Gym" website will identify the closest Everywhere Gym to the user locaton, show the address and marker on the map.  It then allows the user to reserve a time slot at that gym, after name, email, date and time have been selected and submitted.  The reservation will be pushed to the backend firebase database.
